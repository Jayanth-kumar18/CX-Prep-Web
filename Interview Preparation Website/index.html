                                        <div class="answer">
                                            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. Its purpose is to structure content on the web by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other media. HTML provides a framework for web documents and ensures that browsers can render content correctly.

                                            To create a hyperlink in HTML, use the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) tag with the <code>href</code> attribute, which specifies the URL of the link. For example:
                                            <pre><code>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;Visit Example&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
                                            This creates a clickable link that directs the user to "https://www.example.com".

                                            HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are written in the opening tag. They are used to specify properties and behaviors of elements. For example:
                                            <pre><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="Description"&gt;</code></pre>
                                            Here, <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> are attributes of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, specifying the image source and alternate text, respectively.

                                            The <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character encoding, author, and viewport settings. It is placed within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section. For example:
                                            <pre><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code></pre>
                                            This specifies the character encoding for the document.

                                            To create a form in HTML, use the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, which contains form elements such as text inputs, radio buttons, and submit buttons. For example:
                                            <pre><code>&lt;form action="/submit" method="post"&gt;

                                            Here, the <code>action</code> attribute specifies where to send the form data, and the <code>method</code> attribute specifies the HTTP method to use.

                                            HTML5 semantic elements provide meaning to the web content and structure, making it easier for browsers and search engines to understand and process the content. Examples include <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. They are important for improving accessibility, SEO, and maintainability of web pages.

                                            This sets the viewport width to the device's width and scales the content to fit the screen.

                                            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Its purpose is to control the layout, design, and overall visual appearance of web pages by applying styles such as colors, fonts, and spacing.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            CSS can be applied to a web page in three ways:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>Inline CSS:</b> Using the <code>style</code> attribute directly within an HTML element. Example: <code>&lt;div style="color: red;"&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;</code></li>
                                                <li><b>Internal CSS:</b> Placing CSS rules within a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of the HTML document. Example:
                                                <pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
                                        p { color: blue; }

                                            The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements on a web page. It includes:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>Content:</b> The actual content of the box, such as text or images.</li>
                                                <li><b>Padding:</b> Space between the content and the border, inside the element.</li>
                                                <li><b>Border:</b> The edge surrounding the padding (if any), which can be styled.</li>
                                                <li><b>Margin:</b> Space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.</li>

                                    </div>

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            To center a block-level element horizontally, set its left and right margins to auto and specify a width. For example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        width: 50%;
                                        margin-left: auto;
                                        margin-right: auto;
                                    }</code></pre>
                                            This centers the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element within its container.
                                        </div>
                                    </div>

                                            Pseudo-elements are used to style specific parts of an element. They are applied using double colons (::) in CSS. For example:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b><code>::before</code>:</b> Inserts content before the content of an element. Example:

                                            Media queries are used to apply CSS styles based on the characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, resolution, and orientation. They enable responsive design by tailoring the layout for different devices. Example:

                                            Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout module designed to make it easier to create complex layouts and align items within a container. It provides properties for alignment, direction, and spacing of elements. Example:

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system for creating complex web layouts. To create a grid layout, use the <code>display: grid;</code> property on a container and define grid rows and columns using properties like <code>grid-template-rows</code> and <code>grid-template-columns</code>. Example:
                                            <pre><code>.grid-container {
                                        display: grid;
                                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
                                        grid-template-rows: auto;
                                        gap: 10px;
                                    }
                                    
                                    .grid-item {

                                            The <code>z-index</code> property specifies the stack order of positioned elements (those with <code>position</code> set to <code>relative</code>, <code>absolute</code>, <code>fixed</code>, or <code>sticky</code>). Elements with higher <code>z-index</code> values are displayed in front of elements with lower values. Example:
                                            <pre><code>.front {

                                            The <code>opacity</code> property controls the transparency level of an element. It accepts values from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {

                                            This makes the <code>div</code> element 50% transparent.

                                            CSS variables (custom properties) allow you to define reusable values in your stylesheet. They are defined with the <code>--</code> prefix and accessed using the <code>var()</code> function. Example:

                                            The <code>background-image</code> property sets an image as the background of an element. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        background-image: url('background.jpg');

                                            This sets 'background.jpg' as the background image of the <code>div</code> element and ensures it covers the entire element.

                                            Responsive design is achieved by using techniques such as fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. Media queries adjust the layout and styles based on device characteristics like screen width. Example:

                                            CSS transitions allow you to animate changes to CSS properties. You specify the property to animate, the duration, and the timing function. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
                                    }
                                    
                                    div:hover {

                                            This animates the background color change over 0.5 seconds when the <code>div</code> is hovered over.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            The <code>transform</code> property applies transformations to elements, such as rotation, scaling, skewing, and translation. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5);

                                            This rotates the <code>div</code> element by 45 degrees and scales it by 1.5 times.

                                            CSS pseudo-classes apply styles to elements based on their state or position. Examples include:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b><code>:hover</code>:</b> Applies styles when an element is hovered over. Example: <code>a:hover { color: red; }</code></li>

                                            The <code>calc()</code> function allows you to perform calculations to determine CSS property values. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        width: calc(100% - 20px);

                                            This sets the width of the <code>div</code> to 100% of its container minus 20 pixels.
                                        </div>

                                            The <code>box-shadow</code> property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

                                            This adds a shadow that is 5 pixels to the right, 5 pixels down, with a 10-pixel blur radius and a semi-transparent black color.

                                            The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows you to define custom fonts that can be used in your web pages. Example:

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            The <code>visibility</code> property controls whether an element is visible or hidden but still takes up space in the layout. Values include:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b><code>visible</code>:</b> The element is visible.</li>
                                                <li><b><code>hidden</code>:</b> The element is hidden but still occupies space in the layout.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            In contrast, the <code>display</code> property affects the layout, with <code>none</code> completely removing the element from the flow.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            To create a gradient background, use the <code>background-image</code> property with the <code>linear-gradient</code> or <code>radial-gradient</code> function. Example:
                                            <pre><code>div {
                                        background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);
                                    }</code></pre>
                                            This creates a gradient that transitions from red to yellow horizontally.

                                            JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers. It is used for client-side scripting, dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and other functionalities that enhance user experience on websites.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. Closures allow functions to have "private" variables and maintain state between function calls. Example:
                                            <pre><code>function makeCounter() {
                                        let count = 0;
                                        return function() {
                                            count++;
                                            return count;
                                        };
                                    }
                                    
                                    const counter = makeCounter();
                                    console.log(counter()); // 1
                                    console.log(counter()); // 2

                                            Event delegation is a technique where a single event handler is attached to a parent element to manage events for its child elements. This is efficient for handling events on dynamically added elements and improves performance. Example:
                                            <pre><code>document.getElementById('parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
                                        if (event.target && event.target.matches('button.child')) {
                                            console.log('Child button clicked');
                                        }

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax. Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions. Promises represent the completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. The async/await syntax allows for writing asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. Example with promises:
                                            <pre><code>function fetchData() {
                                        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
                                            setTimeout(() => resolve('Data fetched'), 1000);
                                        });
                                    }

                                            JavaScript modules are files that export and import functionality to and from other files. They help in organizing code into reusable pieces. Modules use <code>export</code> and <code>import</code> statements. Example:

                                            The JavaScript event loop manages the execution of asynchronous code. It processes tasks from the event queue, executing them one by one. When an asynchronous operation is completed, its callback is added to the event queue. The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty and processes events from the queue.

                                            A promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It has three states: <code>pending</code>, <code>fulfilled</code>, and <code>rejected</code>. Promises can be created using the <code>Promise</code> constructor and handled with <code>.then()</code>, <code>.catch()</code>, and <code>.finally()</code> methods. Example:
                                            <pre><code>const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

                                            The <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords simplify working with promises by allowing asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style. An <code>async</code> function always returns a promise, and <code>await</code> pauses the execution of the function until the promise resolves. Example:
                                            <pre><code>async function fetchData() {
                                        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');

                                            Errors in JavaScript can be handled using <code>try...catch</code> blocks for synchronous code and <code>.catch()</code> method for promises. For example:

                                            The DOM (Document Object Model) can be manipulated using JavaScript by selecting elements and modifying their properties, attributes, or content. Common methods include:

                                            Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They do not have their own <code>this</code> context and inherit it from their enclosing scope. Example:
                                            <pre><code>const add = (a, b) => a + b;
                                    console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
                                    </code></pre>
                                            Arrow functions are often used for shorter function expressions and handling <code>this</code> more intuitively.

                                            The <code>prototype</code> property allows you to add methods and properties to a constructor function's prototype object, which is shared by all instances of the constructor. Example:

                                            Inheritance in JavaScript can be implemented using prototype-based inheritance or class syntax (ES6). Example using prototypes:

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Event bubbling is a propagation model where an event starts from the innermost element (the target) and bubbles up to the outer elements (ancestors). It allows parent elements to handle events triggered by their children. Event handling can be controlled using methods like <code>stopPropagation()</code>.

                                            The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is an architectural design pattern used to separate an application into three interconnected components:

                                            Frameworks implement MVC by providing structures and conventions for organizing code into these components, facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable applications.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is commonly used for building scalable network applications, such as web servers and real-time applications, due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven model to handle asynchronous operations. It utilizes an event loop and callback functions to manage tasks like I/O operations, allowing the server to handle multiple operations concurrently without waiting for each operation to complete.

                                            The <code>package.json</code> file is used to manage project dependencies, scripts, and metadata in a Node.js project. It lists the packages required for the project, defines project-specific scripts, and provides information about the project like its name, version, and author.

                                            Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request, response, and next function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use((req, res, next) => {
                                        console.log('Middleware function');

                                            React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where data changes dynamically. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently using a virtual DOM.

                                            Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are JavaScript functions or classes that optionally accept inputs (props) and return React elements that describe how the UI should appear. Components can be either stateful or stateless and can be reused throughout an application.

                                            React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include:

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            The virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to optimize updates to the actual DOM by minimizing the number of changes required. When a component’s state or props change, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version (diffing), and applies the minimal set of changes to the real DOM to improve performance.

                                            JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes it easier to create and visualize React components by allowing developers to use a familiar HTML syntax. JSX is compiled to JavaScript function calls by tools like Babel.

                                            State is a JavaScript object that holds data that influences the rendering of a component. It is managed within the component and can be updated using the <code>setState</code> method in class components or the <code>useState</code> hook in functional components. State changes trigger re-rendering of the component.

                                            Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent to child components. They allow components to be dynamic and reusable by passing different data into them. Props are immutable and cannot be changed by the component receiving them.

                                            React Router is a library for handling routing in React applications.

It works by using components like <code>Router</code>, <code>Route</code>, and <code>Link</code> to render different components based on the URL path.

                                            Side effects in React can be managed using the <code>useEffect</code> hook in functional components. This hook allows you to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, and manually changing the DOM after the component renders. It can be configured to run on specific state or prop changes or only on component mount.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Context is a feature in React that allows you to share state or data between components without passing props manually through every level of the component tree. It is used by creating a context object using <code>React.createContext</code>, providing the context value with <code>Context.Provider</code>, and consuming it using <code>Context.Consumer</code> or the <code>useContext</code> hook.

                                            The <code>key</code> prop is used to identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or been removed. It helps React optimize rendering by tracking elements efficiently. Keys should be unique among siblings but do not need to be globally unique.

                                            Lifecycle methods are hooks provided in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component’s lifecycle. Common lifecycle methods include:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><code>componentDidMount</code>: Called after the component is mounted.</li>

                                                <li><code>componentWillUnmount</code>: Called before the component unmounts.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            With functional components, lifecycle methods can be managed using the <code>useEffect</code> hook.

                                            Higher-order components (HOCs) are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They are used to share common functionality or logic between components. HOCs do not modify the original component but enhance it with additional features. Example:

                                            Forms in React can be handled using controlled components or uncontrolled components. Controlled components use state to control form inputs, while uncontrolled components use refs to access form values. The choice depends on the complexity and requirements of the form.

                                            The <code>useRef</code> hook is used to persist values across renders without causing a re-render when the value changes. It can be used to access DOM elements directly or to store mutable values that do not affect the rendering of the component.

                                            Render props is a pattern for sharing code between React components using a function that returns a React element. The function is passed as a prop to the component and is used to render the content. Example:

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Middleware in Express.js is a function that has access to the request object, the response object, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. It can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware function. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use((req, res, next) => {
                                        console.log('Middleware function');

                                            Routing in Express.js is handled using the <code>app.get()</code>, <code>app.post()</code>, <code>app.put()</code>, and <code>app.delete()</code> methods to define routes for different HTTP methods. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.get('/users', (req, res) => {

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            You can serve static files in Express.js using the <code>express.static()</code> middleware. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use(express.static('public'));
                                    
                                    // Now you can serve files from the 'public' directory
                                    // For example, http://localhost:3000/image.png

                                            The <code>app.use()</code> function is used to mount middleware functions at a specific path. It is executed for every request that matches the path. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Errors in Express.js are handled using error-handling middleware. This middleware takes four arguments: <code>err</code>, <code>req</code>, <code>res</code>, and <code>next</code>. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
                                        console.error(err.stack);
                                        res.status(500).send('Something broke!');

                                            JSON data is parsed using the <code>express.json()</code> middleware. This middleware parses incoming JSON requests and makes the data available in <code>req.body</code>. Example:
                                            <pre><code>app.use(express.json());

                                            Template engines are libraries that allow you to dynamically generate HTML pages based on data. In Express.js, you can use template engines like Pug, EJS, or Handlebars by setting the <code>view engine</code> property. Example with Pug:
                                            <pre><code>app.set('view engine', 'pug');

                                            CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) can be configured using the <code>cors</code> middleware. Example:
                                            <pre><code>const cors = require('cors');
                                    app.use(cors());</code></pre>
                                            This will enable CORS for all routes and origins. You can also configure specific options if needed.

                                    </code></pre>
                                            This creates an ascending index on the specified field. Use <code>-1</code> for descending indexes.

                                            MongoDB does not support traditional SQL-style joins, but you can achieve similar results using the <code>$lookup</code> stage in the aggregation pipeline. This allows you to join documents from different collections. Example:
                                            <pre><code>db.orders.aggregate([
                                        {

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            The aggregation pipeline in MongoDB is a framework for performing data aggregation operations. It consists of a series of stages, each of which transforms the data. Stages are executed sequentially, and the output of one stage is passed as input to the next. Common stages include <code>$match</code>, <code>$group</code>, <code>$sort</code>, and <code>$project</code>.

                                            Data validation in MongoDB can be handled using schema validation rules. MongoDB allows you to define validation criteria using JSON Schema when creating or updating collections. This helps enforce data integrity by ensuring that documents conform to specified formats and constraints.

                                            A MongoDB cursor is an iterator that allows you to access the results of a query. When you perform a query with methods like <code>find()</code>, MongoDB returns a cursor which you can use to iterate over the documents. Cursors are lazy and fetch data as needed, which helps manage memory usage efficiently.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            A list is mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after it has been created. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable, which means that once it is created, it cannot be modified in any way. Lists are defined with square brackets `[]`, while tuples are defined with parentheses `()`.

                                    <h3>Interview Questions:</h3>
                                  <div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q1. What is SQL, and why is it important for database manipulation?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with relational databases. It is crucial for database manipulation as it provides commands for creating, modifying, and querying databases, enabling efficient data management and retrieval.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q2. What is the purpose of the INSERT INTO statement in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The INSERT INTO statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It specifies the table and the columns where data should be inserted, followed by the values to be added. For example: <code>INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department) VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'HR');</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q3. How can you update existing records in a table using SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        To update existing records, use the UPDATE statement followed by the table name and the SET clause to specify the columns and new values. The WHERE clause is used to filter which rows should be updated. For example: <code>UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'John Doe';</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q4. What is the DELETE statement used for in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table based on a specified condition. The WHERE clause determines which rows to delete. For example: <code>DELETE FROM employees WHERE age < 30;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q5. How do you use the ALTER TABLE statement in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The ALTER TABLE statement is used to modify an existing table's structure, such as adding or deleting columns, or changing column data types. For example: <code>ALTER TABLE employees ADD salary DECIMAL(10, 2);</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q6. What is the purpose of the DROP TABLE statement?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The DROP TABLE statement is used to delete an entire table and all of its data from the database. This operation is irreversible, so it should be used with caution. For example: <code>DROP TABLE employees;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q7. How can you retrieve unique values from a column using SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        To retrieve unique values, use the DISTINCT keyword in a SELECT statement. For example: <code>SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;</code> will return only unique department names from the employees table.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q8. What is a subquery in SQL, and how is it used?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        A subquery is a query nested inside another query. It can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to provide results that can be used by the outer query. For example: <code>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = (SELECT department FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR');</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q9. What is the purpose of the UNION operator in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The UNION operator is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default. For example: <code>SELECT name FROM employees UNION SELECT name FROM contractors;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q10. How do you create an index on a table in SQL, and why is it useful?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        An index can be created using the CREATE INDEX statement to improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. For example: <code>CREATE INDEX idx_age ON employees (age);</code> helps speed up queries filtering by the age column.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q11. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        INNER JOIN returns only the rows with matching values in both tables. LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table; if no match, NULL values are returned for the right table's columns.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q12. How do you handle NULL values in SQL queries?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        NULL values can be handled using IS NULL or IS NOT NULL conditions in queries. For example: <code>SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age IS NULL;</code> retrieves rows where the age column has NULL values.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q13. What is a view in SQL, and how is it used?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        A view is a virtual table created by a query that selects data from one or more tables. It simplifies complex queries and provides a way to present data without altering the underlying tables. For example: <code>CREATE VIEW employee_view AS SELECT name, age FROM employees;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q14. How do you use the GROUP BY clause in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG to perform calculations on each group. For example: <code>SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q15. What is the purpose of the HAVING clause in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        The HAVING clause is used to filter the results of a GROUP BY query based on aggregate function results. It is similar to the WHERE clause but is used for groups rather than individual rows. For example: <code>SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q16. How can you perform a conditional update on a table in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        To perform a conditional update, use the UPDATE statement with a WHERE clause to specify which rows to update. For example: <code>UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE performance_rating = 'Excellent';</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q17. What is a stored procedure, and how is it used in SQL?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of SQL statements stored in the database. It can be executed with a single call and is used to encapsulate complex queries or operations for reuse and improved performance. For example: <code>CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee_info (IN emp_id INT) BEGIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id; END;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q18. What is a trigger in SQL, and how does it work?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specific events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. It helps enforce business rules and data integrity. For example: <code>CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_employee BEFORE INSERT ON employees FOR EACH ROW BEGIN IF NEW.age < 18 THEN SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Age must be 18 or older'; END IF; END;</code>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q19. How do you ensure data integrity in SQL databases?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        Data integrity is ensured through the use of constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and NOT NULL constraints. These constraints enforce rules on the data and maintain its accuracy and consistency across the database.
    </div>
</div>

<div class="faq">
    <p class="question"><b>Q20. What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?</b><br></p>
    <div class="answer">
        Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing tables into related tables and defining relationships between them. It is important because it minimizes data duplication and ensures that data dependencies are logical and properly maintained.

                                            SQL injection is a technique where attackers insert malicious SQL code into a query through input fields, allowing them to manipulate the database. It can be prevented by using prepared statements, parameterized queries, and input validation to ensure that user inputs are not interpreted as code.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs when attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. Types include stored XSS (where the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server) and reflected XSS (where the script is reflected off a web server). Both can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            SSL/TLS certificate analysis is significant in footprinting because it provides information about the target's encrypted communication channels, including the certificate issuer, expiration dates, and domain names covered by the certificate. This data can help attackers identify additional domains, subdomains, and the security posture of the target's web services.

                                            Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique used to map private IP addresses to a single public IP address or a few public IP addresses. It allows multiple devices on a local network to share a single public IP address when accessing the internet. NAT works by modifying the IP address information in packet headers as they pass through a router or firewall, enabling devices to communicate with external networks while maintaining internal address confidentiality.

                                        <div class="answer">
                                            Multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances system security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before gaining access. This typically includes:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><b>Something you know:</b> A password or PIN.</li>
                                                <li><b>Something you have:</b> A mobile device or security token.</li>
                                                <li><b>Something you are:</b> Biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by adding layers of security beyond just passwords.
